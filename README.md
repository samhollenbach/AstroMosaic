# AstroMosaic

Reads in positions of astrophysical objects in Right Ascension and Declination space, along with total area on the sky to cover and image size, to create a file containing RA and DEC points for images to create a Mosaic.

Note: All calculations are done in degree space, but functions are provided to convert between Right Ascension/Declination and degrees.

## Software Information
A collection of Python scripts that aid in setting up and creating astronomical mosaics from a collection of FITS images. These scripts are to be used in conjunction with IRAF (http://iraf.noao.edu/). Should work on most platforms, but so far only tested on Ubuntu.
