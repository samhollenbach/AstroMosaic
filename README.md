# AstroMosaic

This script read in positions of astrophysical objects in Right Ascension and Declination space, along with total area on the sky to cover, and image size to create a file containing RA and DEC points for images to create a Mosaic.

All calculations are done in degree space, but functions are provided to convert between Right Ascension/Declination and degrees.
